# tCamViewer Operating Instructions
Version 1.0

tCamViewer is an Android app designed to connect to the tCam and tCam-Mini thermal imaging cameras designed by [danjuliodesigns, LLC](https://www.danjuliodesigns.com) and available from [Group Gets](https://www.groupgets.com).

## Installation
The app may be installed from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.danjuliodesigns.tcamViewer) or through side loading. To side load an application the phone must have developer mode enabled and allow unknown applications to be installed. These settings are phone dependent, please check your phone's user manual for specific instructions of how to do this. 

## Operation
Operation of the app is controlled by three main screens.

1. Camera Screen : This is the initial screen and controls the connection to the camera, displays images and video from a connected camera, and allows the images to be saved.
2. Settings Screen : Configures the application and the connected camera, it also allows scanning for connected cameras.
3. Library Screen : Displays saved images and movies and allows them to be exported.

### Camera Screen
The Camera Screen

![Initial Camera Screen](pictures/camera_screen_start.jpg)

It is comprised of a toolbar and image display area.  Toolbar items include the following.



1. **SAVE** : Saves the currently displayed image as a raw .tjsn file in the applications's local file storage area.  Not available if there is not a current image displayed.
2. **CONNECT** : Connect to a camera via WiFi at the network address specified on the Settings Screen.  The menu item changes to **DISCONNECT** when a camera is connected. If a camera fails to connect (usually because of an incorrect IP address or being powered off) then an popup will be displayed within 15-30 seconds informing the user of the problem.
3. **GET** : Obtains a single image from the connected camera.
4. **STREAM** : Start a streaming images from the camera in real time.  Video of the streaming images can be saved as a .tmjsn video file in the application's local file storage area. 
5. [**PALETTE**] : Displays the current palette being used to display the image. Selecting this menu item shows a drop down menu of all of palettes choices available.
<br/>
<br/>
![Typical Camera Screen](pictures/camera_screen_get.jpg)

The image area is comprised of the following regions.

1. *Spot Temperature* : Displays the camera's spot meter temperature in the currently configured units if spot meter display is enabled.
2. Image : Displays the thermal image using the currently selected palette.
3. *Palette Bar* : Displays the current palette with the image's minimum and maximum temperatures (or the word "AGC" if the camera is configured in AGC mode). Clicking on the top or the bottom half of the Palette Bar will select the previous or next palette respectively.
4. *Histogram* : Displays a histogram of temperatures distributed over the image's temperatures.


![Streaming Selections](pictures/camera_screen_start_streaming.jpg)
<br/>
<br/>
Streaming displays a live view from the camera at the maximum rate of ~9 FPS when the user selected the **STREAM** menu item. Streams may be persisted to a .tmjsn file by selecting **Record** instead of **Stream** and later viewed in the Library screen.

![Stopping streaming](pictures/camera_screen_stop_streaming.jpg)
<br/>
<br/>
Streaming/Recording may be terminated by clicking **STREAM** menu item and then selecting "stop".  The video file is saved if recording was selected.

A recording stream is also stopped and the video file saved if the user navigates away from the Camera Screen.  A non-recording stream is temporarily paused and then re-started if the user navigates away from the Camera Screen and then back.

#### Native File Name formats
Native image files (.tjsn and .tmjsn) are stored in sub-directories within the application's local file area.  Their filenames are generated by using the timestamp when they were taken and are stored in folders with names generated by the date they were taken.
<br/>
<br/>
![Native File storage](pictures/native_file_storage.jpg)
<br/>
<br/>

These files may be copied from the phone via the USB interface and shared with the tCam Desktop application available from [danjuliodesigns, LLC](www.danjuliodesigns.com) or they may exported.

#### Exported Files

Images may be saved as jpg files.  They may be exported automatically from the Camera Screen when clicking **SAVE** (if enabled in the Settings Screen), or they may be manually exported while viewing images from the Library Screen.  Saved images may be found in the photo album.

Videos may be saved as mp4 files.  The process takes may take some time depending on the length of the recorded stream.  

Exported images and movies may simply be the image or may include metadata displayed as text around the image depending on the settings selected in the [Settings Screen](#Settings Screen).

### Settings Screen

The Settings Screen is used to configure both the application and the connected camera.
<br/>
<br/>

#### Camera Settings

Camera Settings are displayed when a camera is connected.  Current values are obtained from the camera.

1. *AGC* : Select between the camera's AGC and Radiometric modes.  When AGC mode is selected the data from the camera does not contain temperature data (other than the spot meter) but the image may be higher quality.  When Radiometric mode is selected the the data contains temperature data for each pixel in the image.
2. *Emissivity* : Sets the emissivity for the camera to use when computing temperatures.  Emissivity is represented by an integer percentage value 1 - 100.  A list of emissivity values for common materials may be displayed and selected by pressing the ```>``` button.
3. *Gain* : Sets the gain mode for the camera.  AUTO allows the camera to automatically select high or low operating gain depending on the scene currently being imaged.  HIGH forces the camera into high gain.  LOW forces the camera into low gain.  High gain is typically used for scenes with a lower delta temperature between the minimum and maximum temperatures in the scene and offers 0.01°K resolution, higher accuracy and lower noise.  Low gain is typically used for scenes with a high delta between the minimum and maximum temperatures and offers 0.1°K resolution, slightly lower accuracy and higher noise.
4. *Wifi/Network* : Displays the Wifi/Network Settings screen and allows configuration of the camera Wifi and network settings.

Changes made to AGC, Emissivity and Gain are not saved unless SAVE is selected and confirmed when leaving the Settings Screen.  Settings to Wifi/Network saved from the Wifi/Network Settings screen.

##### Wifi/Network Settings
